# Deep Learning Object Detection using Detectron2

Executed By: Anusha Guruprasad

This repository contains code for training an object detection model using Detectron2, a popular computer vision library built by Facebook AI Research (FAIR). The weights for the file can be downloaded from the Detectron2 GitHub location.

## Setup

To run the code, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   
2. **Install dependencies:**
Ensure you have Python 3 installed. Then install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Prepare your dataset:**

Place your dataset in a directory and structure it according to your needs.

4. **Train the model:**

Modify the code in train_detectron_model function to set the paths to your dataset and configuration file. Then run:

```bash
python train.py
```
